	"Title": "Mathematics Question Generator Website",
	
	"What": "A website for my Mathematics Question Generator Api.",

	"Why": "I wanted a simple front end to make the API easier to use.",

	"HowToUse": "Each question type has a page for generating a question and checking if your answers are correct. There is also the option of requestion a worksheet with a user specified number of questions.",

	"Thoughts": [
	"I wrote this in react, in hindsight standard HTML and JavaScript would have been far easier and simpler.",
	"It isn't much to look at, I'm not so great with design so I kept it very simplistic. I did, however, put effort into making it usable and having helpful error messages and client side validation."

	"LanguagesAndLibraries": [
		{ "LanguageOrLibrary": "TypeScript (React)", "Description": "Used to write the website." },
		{ "LanguageOrLibrary": "HTML and CSS", "Description": "Used as part of the React framework." },
		{ "LanguageOrLibrary": "AWS": "Used to host this until I had to take the API down as the free trial ran out." }
